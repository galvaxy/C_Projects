The equation is f(x)= x^3 - 2*x^2 + x - 3.

With an initial guess of 1.00 the Newton-Raphson sequence is:

Iteration     x (Root)           f(x)
----------------------------------------
    0         1.00000          -3.00000


Initial guess leads to an undefined value.
Derivative of the polynomial is singular at x[0]
