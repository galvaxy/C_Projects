CELESTIAL MECHANICS -> THREE BODY PROBLEM:

 This program calculates the orbits, in 3-D, of three celestial bodies orbiting their center of mass. The program is working in the center of mass frame (cm=(0,0,0), Vcm=<0,0,0>).

 Initialize the masses of the three bodies. All three masses are independent of each other. Units-> kilograms

 Initialize positions of the three bodies. Since the center of mass must be at (0,0,0) only two of the position vectors are independent. The two independent bodies are chosen to be bodies 2 and 3. The initial position of body 1 is then dependent on the initial positions of bodies 2 and 3. Units-> AU

 Initialize velocities of masses. Since the velocity of the center of mass must be <0,0,0,> only two velocities are independent. The two independent bodies are 2 and 3; therefore they have the independent velocities and the velocity of body 1 is dependent. Units-> AU per day
