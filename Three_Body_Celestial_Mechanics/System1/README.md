INTIAL VALUES FOR THIS SYSTEM:

 Masses (Ms = Mass of Sun, Me =  Mass of Earth - in kg):

  Mstar1 -> 5 Ms
  Mstar2 -> Ms
  Mplanet -> 2 Me 

 Initial positions (all positions are in AU):
 
  The initial position of Star1 is calculated from the intial positions of Star2 and Planet such that the center of mass of the system is centered at the origin. Format is <X, Y, Z>

  Star2 position -> <1.5, 0, 0>
  Planet position -> <8.5, 0, 0>

 Initial velocities (all velocities are in AU/day):

  The initial velocity of Star2 is calculated from the the initial velocities of Star1 and Planet such that the center of momentum of the system is centered at the origin. Format is <Vx, Vy, Vz>

  Star1 velocity -> <0, 0.0097, 0.0077>
  Planet velocity -> <0, -0.005, 0.>
