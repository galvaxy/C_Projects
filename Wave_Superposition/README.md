WAVE SUPERPOSITION:

 This program simulates two Gaussian profile waves through a string with fixed ends. The string is 1 m in length, the speed of propagation of the waves, c, are 300 m/s, delta(x) is 0.01 m and delta(t) = delta(x)/ c.

 The gaussian profiles are initialized in initialize.c and the next time steps are calculated and saved to waveSuperposition.txt in the calculate.c file.

 The plots.gp file is a GnuPlot script that can be run using GnuPlot form terminal to create the plots. The plot is animated and save as waveSuperposition.gif.
